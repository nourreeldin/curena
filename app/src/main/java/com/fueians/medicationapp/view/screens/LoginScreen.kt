/**
 * LoginScreen is a Jetpack Compose UI function that displays the login interface.
 *
 * Notes for developers:
 * - This composable is responsible for rendering the login form and handling user interactions.
 * - It should remain UI-focused — delegate authentication logic to a Presenter.
 * - Follow Material Design 3 and accessibility guidelines.
 * - Avoid using direct navigation or data manipulation inside this function.
 * - Keep the layout responsive and test it across multiple screen sizes.
