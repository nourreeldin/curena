/**
 * LoginFragment is responsible for displaying the login UI within a modular screen container.
 *
 * Notes for developers:
 * - Used when navigation between multiple screens or nested UI elements is required.
 * - Should communicate with the corresponding Presenter (e.g., LoginPresenter) to handle logic.
 * - Manage view state, user interactions, and UI updates through Jetpack Compose.
 * - Avoid placing business logic here — delegate it to the Presenter or ViewModel.
