/**
 * InputFieldComponent is a reusable Composable UI element used for text input fields
 * such as username, email, or password across multiple screens.
 *
 * Notes for developers:
 * - Encapsulates standard styling and behavior for input fields to ensure UI consistency.
 * - Supports parameters for label text, input type (e.g., password, email), and validation feedback.
 * - Should integrate with ViewModel or Presenter layers through callbacks or state management.
 * - Keep this component stateless when possible — delegate state handling to higher layers.
