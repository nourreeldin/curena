/**
 * AuthActivity serves as the main container for authentication-related fragments,
 * including the LoginFragment, SignupFragment, and SplashFragment.
 *
 * Notes for developers:
 * - This activity manages navigation between authentication screens.
 * - Use a FragmentContainerView or NavHostFragment to handle fragment transitions.
 * - Keep business logic separate — delegate user actions to the appropriate Presenter.
 * - Ensure smooth transitions between fragments.
 * - This activity should not contain direct data-handling logic.
