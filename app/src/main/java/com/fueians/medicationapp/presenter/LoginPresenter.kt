/**
 * LoginPresenter manages the authentication flow for user login within the MVP architecture.
 *
 * Notes for developers:
 * - Serves as the bridge between the View layer and Model layer.
 * - Responsible for validating user credentials and triggering authentication requests.
 * - Updates the View with success, failure, or validation error messages.
 * - Maintain separation of concerns — this class should not directly modify UI components.
